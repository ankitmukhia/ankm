# React useReducer.

- **useReducer** has always been confusing for me, so I learned it in deapth from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgp_iCVS8ys).

First we have to think that **useReducer** is nothing but solution to useState after it reaches it's limitations.

As your components grow in complexity, it can get harder to see/mantain different components states and update it. As component grow so does t he state logic.
So to reduce this complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access place we use **useReducer**.

We move state logi into a single function outside your component called a **reducer**.

we have this very interesting thought shift, instead of telling React "waht to do" which we did with useState, we specify "what the user just did", it completely changes the perspective.

A reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two arguments: the current state and the action to be performed. It returns the new state.

```js title="reducer.tsx"
 interface Action {
  type: 'increment' | 'decrement';
 }

 const initialState = 0;

 const reducer = (state, action: Action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment':
	 return state + 1;
      case 'decrement':
	  return state - 1;
      default:
	  return state;
   }
 }

 export const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = usereducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount('increment')}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount('decrement')}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
 }
```

# Next.js client component render.

Question: As stated by Next.js, component renders on the server. When it serves to user/(You), you are seeing already pre-rendered page.?

But if that's true, how all this on the fly interaction is possible? **Ex: You click on a button and it changes the count**.

Answer: You can't do that. Next.js does not allow any interaction on the server-side. It's only for static page generation. But most interesting thing Next.js does on client side is called **hidration**, which is how we can interact with with this pre-rendered pages as well.

Yes, indeed even client components pre-rendered in server, which is good coz it help use faster page load etc. And pre-rendered means the static html files/structure.

Then for interaction **React** performs process called **hydration**, **During hydration, React attaches event listeners and state management to the static HTML, making it fully interactive**.

# Parallel and Sequential Fetching

- You need to be aware of two data fetching patterns: Parallel and Sequential.

## Sequential:

- Used when one request depends on another.

In this pattern, you fetch data in a sequence, one after another. Request in a component tree are dependent on each other. **Longer loading times**.

```tsx
function Page(params)  {
	username = getParams(params)
	artist = fetchArtist(username)

	return (
		Display artist name
		Show loading state while Playlist is loading
		Render playlist component with artiestId
	)
}

function Playlist(artistId) {
	playlist = fetchPlaylist(artistId)

	return (
	    Display list playlist
	)
}
```

- artist = fetchArtist(username)

- <sub>
    _(here in between we need some loading state while playlist is loading, So
    we show fallback UI. nested component to prevent blocking the entire route.
    e.g., [suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense),
    [loading.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming))_
  </sub>

- playlist = fetchPlaylist(artistId)

## Parallel:

- Used when request are independent but should run simultaneously.

Load data at the same time. This reduces the total loading time. **Shorter loading times**.

By default, layout and page segments render **in parallel**.

Blocking issue: if async/await is used inside the same component, it will fall back to sequential. Because, nature of async/await is **blocking**.

## Optimizing with Promis.all

- Put multiple request **outside** component.

- Use **Promise.all** to fetch both **artist** and **slbums simultaneously**.

- reduces wait time, but **renders only both request finished.**

# generateStaticParams & generateMetadata

- **generateStaticParams** is used to generate static paths for your dynamic routes.

```js
 export const generateStaticParams() {
    return allPosts.filter((p) => p.publishedAt === "published").
                    map(p => p.slug === params.slug)
 }
```

Above code snippet is used to generate static paths, we are caching the dynamic route values such that it does not calculate or make a request each time we trigger this dynamic page. First, it caches, then it remains the same across other triggers.
