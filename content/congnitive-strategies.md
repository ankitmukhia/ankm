### Self Problem

A cognitive strategy is a mental process or technique used to learn, solve problems, or process information effectively. It helps in thinking, remembering, and understanding concepts.

Examples of Cognitive Strategies:

- **Chunking** – Breaking information into smaller parts to remember it easily.
- **Repetition** – Repeating something multiple times to reinforce learning.
- **Visualization** – Creating mental images to understand or recall information.
- **Self-questioning** – Asking yourself questions to check understanding.
- **Mnemonics** – Using memory aids like acronyms (e.g., GOAT for stating gretness, making rhymes for learning words).
