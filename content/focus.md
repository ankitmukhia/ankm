Focusing deeply on something felt almost impossible to me until I read this book.

[Cal Newport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Newport) talks about the idea of **Deep Work** focused time spent on things that matter, without distraction. He says this kind of work is rare and valuable, and I agree.

What stood out to me was how much time I waste pretending to work. I'll have 10 tabs open, a **Twitter**, **Youtube** and at the end of the day, I barely finish anything that feels real and authentic.

Now I'm trying to schedule at least good amount of time for deep work every day. No phone, **(Alert) the work i do needs internet and laptop so can't cut of that**. So for me that is me and what matters. It sounds easy to do tho, but it's hard. Bcz in today’s world, our phones have become so unconscious they're in our hands before we even think. But rarely do we use them in a truly meaningful way.

I don't think I'll ever be perfect at deep work, but I now understand how shallow work has been draining me. Slowly, I'm learning how to protect my foucs.

Till next time peace!✌️
